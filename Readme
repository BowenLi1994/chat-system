Here is Readme for the project2 of CPD classes
In this project, I realize the following functions:
1. Register a user;
2. Login to the chat system;
3. Exit the chat system;
After log into the chat system, you can do the following tasks:
1. Invite friends;
2. Accept friends' invitation;
3. Sending message to you friends;
4. Log out users' account.

So you can run my code in the following instructions:
1. make --  to compile the code
2. serve user_info_file configration_file --to set up the server
3. client configration_file  -- to open the client
you should open 2 clients
4. r -- to register two users, input your name and you password,like:
name:n1 password:p1
name:n2 password:p2
5. l -- to log into the chat system, input your name and you password
6. i -- invite friends in following format:  i username [message],like:
i p2 [hi]
7. ia -- accept friend's invitation: ia username [message]
ia p1 [hello]
8. m -- send message to friends: m username message
m p1 hi
m p2 hello
9. logout -- logout of you account.
10. exit -- quit the program.
11. when you type control+c on client and server to stop the program.

And I use select function on client side and use pthread on server side.

P.S.:
You'd better follow the instructions above.
Or reopen the program.
